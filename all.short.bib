But there is still much that can be said objectively about the relative importance of Web pages. This paper describes PageRank, a mathod for rating Web pages objectively and mechanically, effectively measuring the human interest and attention devoted to them. We compare PageRank to an idealized random Web surfer. We show how to efficiently compute PageRank for large numbers of pages. And, we show how to apply PageRank to search and to user navigation.},

	OPTannote = {Camlp4 is a preprocessor for OCaml for the implementation of syntax exten- sions using an extensible top down recursive descent parser. New language constructs are translated to OCaml code by syntax expanders that are associated to the syntax extensions. Camlp4 provides quotations and anti-quotations to allow the generation of OCaml code using concrete syntax. The contents of quotations is passed as a string to a quotation expander, which can then process the string in arbitrary ways. A default quotation expander can be defined, but all other quotations have to be typed explictly. The same holds for syntactically ambiguous anti-quotations. As opposed to Maya, the syntax and quotation expanders can not use type information to decide what code to produce.},

@article{Vuduc:2004ly,
	Abstract = {Achieving peak performance from the computational kernels that dominate application                performance often requires extensive machine-dependent tuning by hand. Automatic                tuning systems have emerged in response, and they typically operate by (1)                generating a large number of possible, reasonable implementations of a kernel, and                (2) selecting the fastest implementation by a combination of heuristic modeling,                heuristic pruning, and empirical search (i.e. actually running the code). This paper                presents quantitative data that motivate the development of such a search-based                system, using dense matrix multiply as a case study. The statistical distributions                of performance within spaces of reasonable implementations, when observed on a                variety of hardware platforms, lead us to pose and OPTaddress two general problems                which arise during the search process. First, we develop a heuristic for stopping an                exhaustive compiletime search early if a near-optimal implementation is found.                Secondly, we show how to construct run-time decision rules, based on run-time                inputs, for selecting from among a subset of the best implementations when the space                of inputs can be described by continuously varying features. We address both                problems by using statistical modeling techniques that exploit the large amount of                performance data collected during the search. We demonstrate these methods on actual                performance data collected by the PHiPAC tuning system for dense matrix multiply. We                close with a survey of recent projects that use or otherwise advocate an empirical                search-based approach to code generation and algorithm selection, whether at the                level of computational kernels, compiler and run-time systems, or problem-solving                environments. Collectively, these efforts suggest a number of possible software                architectures for constructing platform-adapted libraries and applications.},

@article{Laufer:2000uq,
	Abstract = {In Java, an interface specifies public abstract methods and associated public constants. Conformance of a class to an interface is by name. We propose to allow structural conformance to interfaces: any class or interface that declares or implements each method in a target interface conforms structurally to the interface, and any expression of the source class or interface type can be used where a value of the target interface type is expected. We argue that structural conformance results in a major gain in flexibility in situations that require retroactive abstraction over types. Structural conformance requires no additional syntax and only small modifications to the Java compiler and optionally, for performance reasons, the virtual machine, resulting in a minor performance penalty. Our extension is type-safe: a cast-free program that compiles without errors will not have any type errors at run time. Our extension is conservative: existing Java programs still compile and run in the same manner as under the original language definition. Finally, structural conformance works well with recent extensions such as Java remote method invocation. We have implemented our extension of Java with structural interface conformance by modifying the Java Developers Kit 1.1.5 source release for Solaris and Windows 95/NT. We have also created a test suite for the extension.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, we survey the design space of a new class of architectures called Grid Processor Architectures (GPAs). These architectures are designed to scale with technology, allowing faster clock rates than conventional architectures while providing superior instruction-level parallelism on traditional workloads and high performance across a range of application classes. A GPA consists of an array of ALUs, each with limited control, connected by a thin operand network. Programs are executed by mapping blocks of statically scheduled instructions to the ALU array and executing them dynamically in dataflow order. This organization enables the critical paths of instruction blocks to be executed on chains of ALUs without transmitting temporary values back to the register file, avoiding most of the large, unscalable structures that limit the scalability of conventional architectures. Finally, we present simulation results of a preliminary design, the GPA-1. With a half-cycle routing delay, we obtain performance roughly equal to an ideal 8-way, 512-entry window superscalar core. With no inter-ALU delay, perfect memory, and perfect branch prediction, the IPC of the GPA-1 is more than twice that of the ideal superscalar core, achieving an average of 11 IPC across nine SPEC CPU2000 and Mediabench benchmarks.},

	Abstract = {This paper describes the polymorphous TRIPS architecture which can be configured for different granularities and types of parallelism. TRIPS contains mechanisms that enable the processing cores and the on-chip memory system to be configured and combined in different modes for instruction, data, or thread-level parallelism. To adapt to small and large-grain concurrency, the TRIPS architecture contains four out-of-order, 16-wide-issue Grid Processor cores, which can be partitioned when easily extractable fine-grained parallelism exists. This approach to polymorphism provides better performance across a wide range of application types than an approach in which many small processors are aggregated to run workloads with irregular parallelism. Our results show that high performance can be obtained in each of the three modes--ILP, TLP, and DLP-demonstrating the viability of the polymorphous coarse-grained approach for future microprocessors.},

	Abstract = {Distributed processors must balance communication and concurrency. When dividing instructions among the processors, key factors are the available concurrency, criticality of dependence chains, and communication penalties. The amount of concurrency determines the importance of the other factors: if concurrency is high, wider distribution of instructions is likely to tolerate the increased operand routing latencies. If concurrency is low, mapping dependent instructions close to one another is likely to reduce communication costs that contribute to the critical path. This paper explores these tradeoffs for distributed Explicit Dataflow Graph Execution (EDGE) architectures that execute blocks of dataflow instructions atomically. A runtime block mapper assigns instructions from a single thread to distributed hardware resources (cores) based on compiler-assigned instruction identifiers. We explore two approaches: fixed strategies that map all blocks to the same number of cores, and adaptive strategies that vary the number of cores for each block. The results show that best fixed strategy varies, based on the cores' issue width. A simple adaptive strategy improves performance over the best fixed strategies for single and dual-issue cores, but its benefits decrease as the cores' issue width increases. These results show that by choosing an appropriate runtime block mapping strategy, average performance can be increased by 18%, while simultaneously reducing average operand communication by 70%, saving energy as well as improving performance. These results indicate that runtime block mapping is a promising mechanism for balancing communication and concurrency in distributed processors.},

	Abstract = {As multicore architectures enter the mainstream, there is a pressing demand for high-level programming models that can effectively map to them. Stream programming offers an attractive way to expose coarse-grained parallelism, as streaming applications (image, video, {DSP,} etc.) are naturally represented by independent filters that communicate over explicit data {channels.In} this paper, we demonstrate an end-to-end stream compiler that attains robust multicore performance in the face of varying application characteristics. As benchmarks exhibit different amounts of task, data, and pipeline parallelism, we exploit all types of parallelism in a unified manner in order to achieve this generality. Our compiler, which maps from the {StreamIt} language to the 16-core Raw architecture, attains a 11.2x mean speedup over a single-core baseline, and a 1.84x speedup over our previous work.},

	Abstract = {This work presents a novel scheme to schedule loops for clustered microarchitectures. The scheme is based on a preliminary cluster assignment phase implemented through graph partitioning techniques followed by a scheduling phase that integrates register allocation and spill code generation. The graph partitioning scheme is shown to be very effective due to its global view of the whole code while the partition is generated. Results show a significant speedup when compared with previously proposed techniques. For some processor configuration the average speedup for the {SPECfp95} is 23\% with respect to the published scheme with the best performance. Besides, the proposed scheme is much faster (between 2-7 times, depending on the configuration).},

	OPTannote = {``Concepts'' are an essential language feature needed to support generic programming in the large. Concepts allow for succinct expression of bounds on type parameters of generic algorithms, enable systematic organization of problem domain abstractions, and make generic algorithms easier to use. In this paper we formalize the design of a type system and semantics for concepts that is suitable for non-type-inferencing languages. Our design shares much in common with the type classes of Haskell, though our primary influence is from best practices in the \Cpp{} community, where concepts are used to document type requirements for templates in generic libraries. The technical development in this paper defines an extension to System F and a type-directed translation from the extension back to System F. The translation is proved sound; the proof is written in the human readable but machine checkable Isar language and has been automatically verified by the Isabelle proof assistant. This document was generated directly from the Isar theory files using Isabelle's support for literate proofs.},

	OPTannote = {This paper presents the design of G, a new language specifically created for generic programming. We review and identify important language features of C++ and Haskell in light of the past decade of generic library research and development. Based on this analysis we propose and evaluate relevant language design decisions for G. Generic programming is concerned with the construction of libraries of reusable software components and is inherently about programming ``in the large.'' Thus, the design of G places its greatest emphasis on modularity and safety, while also providing run-time efficiency and programmer convenience. This paper focuses on name scoping and type checking for generic functions, support for dispatching to algorithm specializations, support for type associations among abstractions, and separate compilation. The resulting design for G includes three novel aspects: scoped models declarations, nested types in concepts, and optional type constraints on generic functions. },

	Abstract = {Modeling uranium transport at the Hanford 300 Area presents new challenges for high performance computing. A field-scale three-dimensional domain with an hoOPTurly fluctuating Columbia river stage coupled to flow in highly permeable sediments results in fast groundwater flow rates requiring small time steps. In this work, high-performance computing has been applied to simulate variably saturated groundwater flow and tracer transport at the 300 Area using PFLOTRAN. Simulation results are presented for discretizations up to 10.8 million degrees of freedom, while PFLOTRAN performance was assessed on up to one billion degrees of freedom and 12,000 processor cores on Jaguar, the Cray XT4 supercomputer at ORNL.},

	Abstract = {We present a reduction from the problem of colouring the vertices of the graph to the maximum independent set problem (MISP) showing that for an <i>n</i>-vertex graph <i>G</i> the sum of the chromatic number of <i>G</i> and the independence number of a graph derived from the complement of <i>G</i> is equal to <i>n</i>. We investigate the applicability of the MISP greedy algorithm to the graph colouring problem. We prove that the well-known Leighton RLF algorithm and an algorithm obtained by modifying the MISP greedy heuristic behave in exactly the same way.},

	Abstract = {This paper points out the connection between the basic scheduling or timetabling problem with the well known problem of colouring the vertices of a graph in such a way that (i) no two adjacent vertices are the same colour and (ii) the number of colours used is a minimum. We give an algorithm for colouring a graph subject to (i) and give a new easily determined bound for the number of colours needed. This same bound is also a new upper bound for the chromatic number of a graph in terms of the degrees of its vertices. 10.1093/comjnl/10.1.85},

@article{Barendregt:1993cr,
	Abstract = {Illative combinatory logic consists of the theory of combinators or lambda calculus extended by extra constants (and corresponding axioms and rules) intended to capture inference. The paper considers systems of illative combinatory logic that are sound for first-order propositional and predicate calculus. The interpretation from ordinary logic into the illative systems can be done in two ways: following the propositions-as-types paradigm, in which derivations become combinators or, in a more direct way, in which derivations are not translated. Both translations are closely related in a canonical way. The two direct translations turn out to be complete. The paper fulfills the program of Church [1932], [1933] and Curry [1930] to base logic on a consistent system of {\^I}{\guillemotright}-terms or combinators. Hitherto this program had failed because systems of ICL were either too weak (to provide a sound interpretation) or too strong (sometimes even inconsistent).},

	Abstract = {We introduce the blame calculus, which adds the notion of blame from Findler and Felleisen's contracts to a system similar to Siek and Taha's gradual types and Flanagan's hybrid types. We characterise where positive and negative blame can arise by decomposing the usual notion of subtype into positive and negative subtyping, and show that these recombine to yield naive subtyping. Naive typing has previously appeared in type systems that are unsound, but we believe this is the first time naive subtyping has played a role in establishing type soundness. },

@inproceedings{Musser:1989:GP,
	Abstract = {Generic programming centers around the idea of
                  abstracting from concrete, efficient algorithms to
                  obtain generic algorithms that can be combined with
                  different data representations to produce a wide
                  variety of useful software. Four kinds of
                  abstraction-data, algorithmic, structural, and
                  representational-are discussed, with examples of
                  their use in building an Ada library of software
                  components. The main topic discussed is generic
                  algorithms and an approach to their formal
                  specification and verification, with illustration in
                  terms of a partitioning algorithm such as is used in
                  the quicksort algorithm. It is argued that
                  generically programmed software component libraries
                  offer important advantages for achieving software
                  productivity and reliability.},

@inproceedings{jazayeri98:_generic_programming,
	Abstract = {Generic programming is a sub-discipline of computer
                  science that deals with finding abstract
                  representations of efficient algorithms, data
                  structures, and other software concepts, and with
                  their systematic organization. The goal of generic
                  programming is to express algorithms and data
                  structures in a broadly adaptable, interoperable
                  form that allows their direct use in software
                  construction. Key ideas include: Expressing
                  algorithms with minimal assumptions about data
                  abstractions, and vice versa, thus making them as
                  interoperable as possible. Lifting of a concrete
                  algorithm to as general a level as possible without
                  losing efficiency; i.e., the most abstract form such
                  that when specialized back to the concrete case the
                  result is just as efficient as the original
                  algorithm. When the result of lifting is not general
                  enough to cover all uses of an algorithm,
                  additionally providing a more general form, but
                  ensuring that the most efficient specialized form is
                  automatically chosen when applicable. Providing more
                  than one generic algorithm for the same purpose and
                  at the same level of abstraction, when none
                  dominates the others in efficiency for all
                  inputs. This introduces the necessity to provide
                  sufficiently precise characterizations of the domain
                  for which each algorithm is the most efficient. },

                  the subject of an active development characterized
                  by continued controversy over basic principles. In
                  this paper, we formalize a view of these principles
                  somewhat similar to that of J. H. Morris. We
                  introduce an extension of the typed lambda calculus
                  which permits user-defined types and polymorphic
                  functions, and show that the semantics of this
                  language satisfies a representation theorem which

	Abstract = {Compiler technology for multimedia extensions must effectively utilize not only the SIMD compute engines but also the various levels of the memory hierarchy: superword registers, multi-level caches and TLB. In this paper, we describe a compiler that combines optimization across all levels of the memory hierarchy with automatic generation of SIMD code for multimedia extensions. At the high-level, model-guided empirical optimization is used to transform code to optimize for all levels of the memory hierarchy. This compiler interacts with a backend compiler exploiting superword-level parallelism that takes sequential code as input and produces SIMD code. This paper discusses how we have combined these technologies into a single framework. Through a case study with matrix multiply, we observe performance results that outperform the hand-tuned Intel MKL library, and achieve performance that is within 4% of the ATLAS self-tuning library with architectural defaults and more than 4X faster than the native Intel compiler.},

@article{Kandemir:2005uq,
	Abstract = {Exploiting spatial and temporal locality is essential for obtaining high performance on modern computers. Writing programs that exhibit high locality of reference is difficult and error-prone. Compiler researchers have developed loop transformations that allow the conversion of programs to exploit locality. Recently, transformations that change the memory layouts of multi-dimensional arrays--called data transformations--have been proposed. Unfortunately, both data and loop transformations have some important drawbacks. In this work, we present an integrated framework that uses loop and data transformations in concert to exploit the benefits of both approaches while minimizing the impact of their disadvantages. Our approach works inter-procedurally on acyclic call graphs, uses profile data to eliminate layout conflicts, and is unique in its capability of resolving conflicting layout requirements of different references to the same array in the same nest and in different nests for regular array-based applications. The optimization technique presented in this paper has been implemented in a source-to-source translator. We evaluate its performance using standard benchmark suites and several math libraries (complete programs) with large input sizes. Our experimental results show that the proposed approach improves the performance of the applications optimized by using the current state-of-the-art techniques by 8.2% on the average. This reduction comes from three important characteristics of the technique, namely, resolving layout conflicts between references to the same array in a loop nest, determining a suitable order to propagate layout modifications across loop nests, and propagating layouts between different procedures in the program--all in a unified framework. The locality optimization technique presented in this paper tries to exploit locality in the innermost loop positions. This strategy, in most cases, generates dependence-free outer loops, which can be safely parallelized.},

                 matrix-matrix multiplication that is part of the widely used GotoBLAS library. Design decisions 
                 are justified by successively refining a model of architectures with multilevel memories. 
                 A simple but effective algorithm for executing this operation results. Implementations on a 
                 broad selection of architectures are shown to achieve near-peak performance.},

	Abstract = {
MLF is a language that extends both ML and System F and combines the
benefits of both. We propose a dag representation of MLF types that
superposes a term-dag, encoding the underlying term-structure with
sharing, and a binding tree, encoding the binding-structure. This
representation is more canonical as it factors out most of the
notational details of the original definition; it is also closely
related to first-order terms. Moreover, it permits a simpler and more
direct definition of type instance that combines type-instance on
first-order term-dags, simple operations on dags, and a control that
allows or rejects potential instances. Thanks to this representation, we
obtain an incremental linear-time unification algorithm for MLF types,
which we prove sound and complete with respect to the specification.
  We also extend term graphs to express constraints on graphs that can
be rewritten incrementally, which suffices to describe all operations
needed by type inference.

The need for direct memory manipulation through pointers is essential in
many applications. However, it is also commonly understood that the use (or
probably misuse) of pointers is often a rich source of program errors.
Therefore, approaches that can effectively enforce safe use of pointers in
programming are highly sought after.  ATS is a programming language with a
type system rooted in a recently developed framework Applied Type System,
and a novel and desirable feature in ATS lies in its support for safe
programming with pointers through a novel notion of {\em stateful
views}. In particular, even pointer arithmetic is allowed in ATS and
guaranteed to be safe by the type system of ATS.  In this paper, we give an
overview of this feature in ATS, presenting some interesting examples based
on a prototype implementation of ATS to demonstrate the practicality of
safe programming with pointer through stateful views.

The wide practice of objected oriented programming (OOP) in current
software practice is evident. Despite extensive studies on typing
programming objects, it is still undeniably a challenging research task to
design a type system that can satisfactorily account for a variety of
features (e.g., binary methods and multiple inheritance) in OOP. In this
paper, we present a typeful approach to implementing objects that makes use
of a recently introduced notion of guarded datatypes. In particular, we
demonstrate how the feature of multiple inheritance can be supported with
this approach, presenting a simple and general account for multiple
inheritance in a typeful manner.

Gentzen's Hauptsatz -- cut elimination theorem -- in sequent calculi
reveals a fundamental property on logic connectives in various logics such
as classical logic and intuitionistic logic.  In this paper, we implement a
procedure in Haskell to perform cut elimination for intuitionistic sequent
calculus, where we use types to guarantee that the procedure can only
return a cut-free proof of the same sequent when given a proof of a sequent
that may contain cuts.  The contribution of the paper is two-fold.  On
the one hand, we present an interesting (and somewhat unexpected) application
of the current type system of Haskell, illustrating through a concrete
example how some typical use of dependent types can be simulated in
Haskell. On the other hand, we identify several problematic issues with
such a simulation technique and then suggest some approaches to OPTaddressing
these issues in Haskell.

	Abstract = {Writing performance-critical programs can be frustrating because
   optimizing compilers for imperative languages tend to be
   unpredictable. For a subset of optimizations - those that simplify
   rather than reorder code - it would be useful to prove that a compiler
   reliably performs optimizations. We show that adopting a
   ``superanalysis'' approach to optimization enables such a proof. By
   analogy with linear algebra, we define the nullspace of an optimizer
   as those programs it reduces to the empty program. To span the
   nullspace, we define rewrite rules that de-optimize programs by
   introducing abstraction. For a model compiler we prove that any
   sequence of de-optimizing rewrite rule applications is undone by the
   optimizer. Thus, we are able to give programmers a clear mental model
   of what simplifications the compiler is guaranteed to perform, and
   make progress on the problem of ``abstraction penalty'' in imperative
   languages.},

                 and convenient alternative to C-style callback
                 functions. It allows logical and algebraic expressions
                 to be passed to functions as arguments, and inlined
                 directly into the function body. Expression templates
                 also solve the problem of evaluating vector and matrix
                 expressions in a single pass without temporaries.},

	Abstract = {Template metaprograms can generate useful code when
                 interpreted by the compiler, which results in large
                 speed increases for many applications. A simple example
                 that generates factorials at compile time is presented.
                 Although this technique might seem like just a cute C++
                 trick, it becomes powerful when combined with normal
                 C++ code. In this hybrid approach, source code contains
                 two programs: the normal C++ runtime program, and a
                 template metaprogram that runs at compile time.
                 Template metaprograms can generate useful code when
                 interpreted by the compiler, such as a massively
                 inlined algorithm-that is, an implementation of an
                 algorithm that works for a specific input size, and has
                 its loops unrolled. This results in large speed
                 increases for many applications. The article presents a
                 simple template metaprogram that generates a bubble
                 sort algorithm and its performance is analysed.},

                   meta-programming, in particular program generation, and
                   its use in software development. The second part
                   introduces a basic calculus, related to FreshML, that
                   supports program generation (as described through
                   examples and a translation of MetaML into it) and
                   programming in-the-large (this is demonstrated by a
                   translation of CMS into it).},

                 and convenient alternative to C-style callback
                 functions. It allows logical and algebraic expressions
                 to be passed to functions as arguments, and inlined
                 directly into the function body. Expression templates
                 also solve the problem of evaluating vector and matrix
                 expressions in a single pass without temporaries.},

@article{Zhao:2005qf,
	Abstract = {Array syntax, which is supported in many technical programming languages, adds expressive power by allowing operations on and assignments to whole arrays and array sections. To compile an array assignment statement to a uniprocessor, the language processor must convert the statement into a loop that has the same meaning. This process is called scalarization.Scalarization presents a significant technical problem because an array assignment needs to be implemented as if all inputs are fetched before any outputs are stored. Since a loop intermixes loads and stores, the compiler typically allocates a temporary array to hold the intermediate result. Because these extra temporary arrays can cause performance problems in cache, many techniques have been developed to avoid their use or minimize their size.In this paper, we present a novel application of two compiler strategies--loop alignment and loop skewing--to OPTaddress this problem. We show that these strategies can achieve the asymptotically minimal memory allocation for stencil computations. Our experiments with loop alignment and loop skewing demonstrate that it is extremely effective in improving memory hierarchy performance of Fortran 90 array code on standard uniprocessors. The result should be applicable to other array languages, such as MATLAB.},

	Abstract = {The framework of graph transformation combines the potentials and advantages
of both, graphs and rules, to a single computational paradigm. In this paper we
present some recent developments in applying graph transformation as a rule-based
framework for the specification and development of systems, languages, and tools.
After reviewing the basic features of graph transformation, we discuss a selection of
applications, including the evaluation of functional expressions, the specification of
an interactive graphical tool, an example specification for abstract data types, and
the definition of a visual database query language. The case studies indicate the
need for suitable structuring principles which are independent of a particular graph
transformation approach. To this end, we present the concept of a transformation
unit, which allows systematic and structured specification and programming based
on graph transformation.},

	Abstract = {If the set of atomic formulas is augmented by adding a `universal
formula' and a `null formula', then the equivalence classes of this set under
alphabetic variation form a complete non-modular lattice, with `instance'
as the partial ordering, `greatest common instance' as the meet operation,
and `least common generalization' as the join operation. The greatest common
instance of two formulas can be obtained from Robinson's Unification Algorithm.
An algorithm is given for computing the least common generalization of two
formulas, the covering relation of the lattice is determined, bounds are
obtained on the length of chains from one formula to another, and it is shown
that any formula is the least common  generalization of its set of ground
instances.
A transformational system is a finite set of clauses containing only units
and transformations, which are clauses containing exactly one positive and one
negative literal. It is shown that every unsatisfiable transformational system
has a refutation where every resolution has at least one resolvend which is an
initial clause. An algorithm is given for computing a common generalization of
all atomic formulas which can be derived from a transformational system, and
it is shown that there is no decision procedure for transformational systems.},

	Abstract = {We explore the thesis that type structure is a syntactic discipline
for maintaining levels of abstraction. Traditionally, this view has been
formalized algebraically, but the algebraic approach fails to encompass
higher-order functions.  For this purpose, it is necessary to generalize
homomorphic functions to relations; the result is an `abstraction' theorem
that is applicable to the typed lambda calculus and various extensions,
including user-defined types. Finally, we consider polymorphic functions,
and show that the abstraction theorem captures Strachey's concept of
parametric, as opposed to ad hoc, polymorphism.},

@techreport{Cheney:2003fq,
	Abstract = {Classical phantom types are datatypes in which type constraints are expressed using type variables that do not appear in the datatype cases themselves. They can be used to embed typed languages into Haskell or ML. However, while such encodings guarantee that only well-formed data can be constructed, they do not permit type-safe deconstruction without additional tagging and run-time checks. We introduce first-class phantom types, which make such constraints explicit via type equations. Examples of first-class phantom types include typed type representations and typed higher-order abstract syntax trees. These types can be used to support typed generic functions, dynamic typing, and staged compilation in higher-order, statically typed languages such as Haskell or Standard ML. In our system, type constraints can be equations between type constructors as well as type functions of higher-order kinds. We prove type soundness and decidability for a Haskell-like language extended by first-class phantom types.},

@inproceedings{Liang:1995ia,
	Abstract = {We show how a set of building blocks can be used to construct
programming language interpreters, and present implementations
of such building blocks capable of supporting many
commonly known features, including simple expressions,
three different function call mechanisms (call-by-name, callby-
value and lazy evaluation), references and assignment,
nondeterminism, first-class continuations, and program tracing.
The underlying mechanism of our system is monad transformers,
a simple form of abstraction for introducing a wide
range of computational behaviors, such as state, I/O, continuations,
and exceptions.
Our work is significant in the following respects. First,
we have succeeded in designing a fully modular interpreter
based on monad transformers that includes features missing
from Steele's, Espinosa's, and Wadler's earlier efforts.
Second, we have found new ways to lift monad operations
through monad transformers, in particular difficult cases not
achieved in Moggi's original work. Third, we have demonstrated
that interactions between features are reflected in
liftings and that semantics can be changed by reordering
monad transformers. Finally, we have implemented our
interpreter in Gofer, whose constructor classes provide just
the added power over Haskell's type classes to allow precise
and convenient expression of our ideas. This implementation
includes a method for constructing extensible unions
and a form of subtyping that is interesting in its own right.},

	OPTannote = {Generic programming has recently emerged as a paradigm
for developing highly-reusable software libraries, most notably in C++.
We have designed and implemented a constrained generics
extension for C++ to support modular type-checking of generic
algorithms and to OPTaddress other issues associated with unconstrained
generics.
To be as broadly applicable as possible, generic algorithms are
defined with minimal requirements on their inputs.
At the same time, to not lose potential efficiency, generic algorithms
may have multiple implementations that exploit features of specific
classes of inputs.
This process of algorithm specialization relies on non-local type
information and conflicts directly with the local nature of modular
type-checking.
In this paper, we review the design and implementation of our
extensions for generic programming in C++, describe the issues of
algorithm specialization and modular type-checking in detail, and
discuss the important design tradeoffs in trying to accomplish both.
We present the particular design that we chose for our implementation,
with the goal of hitting the sweet spot in this interesting design space.},

@inproceedings{Amtoft:2006dt,
	Abstract = {This paper specifies, via a Hoare-like logic, an interprocedural and flow sensitive (but termination insensitive) information flow analysis for object-oriented programs. Pointer aliasing is ubiquitous in such programs, and can potentially leak confidential information. Thus the logic employs independence assertions to describe the noninterference property that formalizes confidentiality, and employs region assertions to describe possible aliasing. Programmer assertions, in the style of JML, are also allowed, thereby permitting a more fine-grained specification of information flow policy.The logic supports local reasoning about state in the style of separation logic. Small specifications are used; they mention only the variables and OPTaddresses relevant to a command. Specifications are combined using a frame rule. An algorithm for the computation of postconditions is described: under certain assumptions, there exists a strongest postcondition which the algorithm computes.

	Abstract = {We study the problem of certifying programs combining imperative and
  functional features within the general framework of type theory.
  
  Type theory constitutes a powerful specification language, which is
  naturally suited for the proof of purely functional programs. To
  deal with imperative programs, we propose a logical interpretation
  of an annotated program as a partial proof of its specification. The
  construction of the corresponding partial proof term is based on a
  static analysis of the effects of the program, and on the use of
  monads. The usual notion of monads is refined in order to account
  for the notion of effect. The missing subterms in the partial proof
  term are seen as proof obligations, whose actual proofs are left to
  the user. We show that the validity of those proof obligations
  implies the total correctness of the program.
  We also establish a result of partial completeness.
  
  This work has been implemented in the Coq proof assistant.
  It appears as a tactic taking an annotated program as argument and
  generating a set of proof obligations. Several nontrivial
  algorithms have been certified using this tactic.},

Improvements related to these sequences have dealt with either the consumption of the markers or the removal of the markers once they appear. Here we present an improvement that eliminates the production of marker sequences of length greater than one. This improvement results in the C machine, a more space and time efficient variant of K. We then apply the classic optimization of short-circuiting operand variable dereferences to create the call-by-need S machine. Finally, we combine the two improvements in the CS machine. On our benchmarks this machine uses half the stack space, performs one quarter as many updates, and executes between 27 0.000000aster and 17lower than our L variant of Sestoft's lazy Krivine machine. More interesting is that on one benchmark L, S, and C consume unbounded space, but CS consumes constant space. Our comparisons to Sestoft's Mark 2 machine are not exact, however, since we restrict ourselves to unpreprocessed closed lambda terms. Our variant of his machine does no environment trimming, conversion to deBruijn-style variable access, and does not provide basic constants, data type constructors, or the recursive let. (The Y combinator is used instead.)},

	OPTannote = {The past decade of experience has demonstrated that the generic programming methodology is highly effective for the design, implementation, and use of large-scale software libraries. The fundamental principle of generic programming is the realization of interfaces for entire sets of components, based on their essential syntactic and semantic requirements, rather than for any particular components. Many programming languages have features for describing interfaces between software components, but none completely support the approach used in generic programming. We have recently developed G, a language designed to provide first-class language support for generic programming and large-scale libraries. In this paper, we present an overview of G and analyze the interdependence between language features and libraries design in light of a complete implementation of the Standard Template Library using G. In addition, we discuss important issues related to modularity and encapsulation in large-scale libraries and how language support for validation of components in isolation can prevent many common problems in component integration. },

	OPTannote = {``Concepts'' are an essential language feature needed to support generic programming in the large. Concepts allow for succinct expression of bounds on type parameters of generic algorithms, enable systematic organization of problem domain abstractions, and make generic algorithms easier to use. In this paper we present the design of a type system and semantics for concepts that is suitable for non-type-inferencing languages. Our design shares much in common with the type classes of Haskell, though our primary influence is from best practices in the \Cpp{} community, where concepts are used to document type requirements for templates in generic libraries. Concepts include a novel combination of associated types and same-type constraints that do not appear in type classes, but that are similar to nested types and type sharing in ML.},

@inproceedings{Gordon:2001nr,
	Abstract = {The Microsoft .NET Framework is a new computing architecture designed to support a variety of distributed applications and web-based services. .NET software components are typically distributed in an object-oriented intermediate language, Microsoft IL, executed by the Microsoft Common Language Runtime. To allow convenient multi-language working, IL supports a wide variety of high-level language constructs, including class-based objects, inheritance, garbage collection, and a security mechanism based on type safe execution.This paper precisely describes the type system for a substantial fragment of IL that includes several novel features: certain objects may be allocated either on the heap or on the stack; those on the stack may be boxed onto the heap, and those on the heap may be unboxed onto the stack; methods may receive arguments and return results via typed pointers, which can reference both the stack and the heap, including the interiors of objects on the heap. We present a formal semantics for the fragment. Our typing rules determine well-typed IL instruction sequences that can be assembled and executed. Of particular interest are rules to ensure no pointer into the stack outlives its target. Our main theorem asserts type safety, that well-typed programs in our IL fragment do not lead to untrapped execution errors.Our main theorem does not directly apply to the product. Still, the formal system of this paper is an abstraction of informal and executable specifications we wrote for the full product during its development. Our informal specification became the basis of the product team's working specification of type-checking. The process of writing this specification, deploying the executable specification as a test oracle, and applying theorem proving techniques, helped us identify several security critical bugs during development.},

	Abstract = {Functional Reactive Programming, or FRP, is a general framework for programming hybrid systems in a high-level, declarative manner. The key ideas in FRP are its notions of behaviors and events. Behaviors are time-varying, reactive values, while events are time-ordered sequences of discrete-time event occurrences. FRP is the essence of Fran, a domain-specific language embedded in Haskell for programming reactive animations, but FRP is now also being used in vision, robotics and other control systems applications. In this paper we explore the formal semantics of FRP and how it relates to an implementation based on streams that represent (and therefore only approximate) continuous behaviors. We show that, in the limit as the sampling interval goes to zero, the implementation is faithful to the formal, continuous semantics, but only when certain constraints on behaviors are observed. We explore the nature of these constraints, which vary amongst the FRP primitives. Our results show both the power and limitations of this approach to language design and implementation. As an example of a limitation, we show that streams are incapable of representing instantaneous predicate events over behaviors.},

	Abstract = {Generic programming centers around the idea of abstracting from concrete? ef 
 cient algorithms to obtain generic algorithms that can be combined with di erent
data representations to produce a wide variety of useful software  For example? a
class of generic sorting algorithms can be de ned which work with  nite sequences
but which can be instantiated in di erent ways to produce algorithms working on
arrays or linked lists 
Four kinds of abstraction -- data, algorithmic, structural, and representational --
are discussed, with examples of their use in building an Ada library of software
components  The main topic discussed is generic algorithms and an approach to
their formal speci cation and verification, with illustration in terms of a partitioning
algorithm such as is used in the quicksort algorithm  It is argued that generically
programmed software component libraries o er important advantages for achieving
software productivity and reliability },

@article{G.-D.-Plotkin:1975on,
	Abstract = {This paper examines the old question of the relationship between ISWIM and the ?-calculus, using the distinction between call-by-value and call-by-name. It is held that the relationship should be mediated by a standardisation theorem. Since this leads to difficulties, a new ?-calculus is introduced whose standardisation theorem gives a good correspondence with ISWIM as given by the SECD machine, but without the letrec feature. Next a call-by-name variant of ISWIM is introduced which is in an analogous correspondence withthe usual ?-calculus. The relation between call-by-value and call-by-name is then studied by giving simulations of each language by the other and interpretations of each calculus in the other. These are obtained as another application of the continuation technique. Some emphasis is placed throughout on the notion of operational equality (or contextual equality). If terms can be proved equal in a calculus they are operationally equal in the corresponding language. Unfortunately, operational equality is not preserved by either of the simulations.},

	Abstract = {This paper describes the new Java memory model, which has been revised as part of Java 5.0. The model specifies the legal behaviors for a multithreaded program; it defines the semantics of multithreaded Java programs and partially determines legal implementations of Java virtual machines and compilers.The new Java model provides a simple interface for correctly synchronized programs -- it guarantees sequential consistency to data-race-free programs. Its novel contribution is requiring that the behavior of incorrectly synchronized programs be bounded by a well defined notion of causality. The causality requirement is strong enough to respect the safety and security properties of Java and weak enough to allow standard compiler and hardware optimizations. To our knowledge, other models are either too weak because they do not provide for sufficient safety/security, or are too strong because they rely on a strong notion of data and control dependences that precludes some standard compiler transformations.Although the majority of what is currently done in compilers is legal, the new model introduces significant differences, and clearly defines the boundaries of legal transformations. For example, the commonly accepted definition for control dependence is incorrect for Java, and transformations based on it may be invalid.In addition to providing the official memory model for Java, we believe the model described here could prove to be a useful basis for other programming languages that currently lack well-defined models, such as C++ and C#.},

  abstract = {Modern integrated development environments (IDEs) offer
  recommendations to aid development, such as auto-completions, refactorings,
  and fixes for compilation errors. Recommendations for each code location are
  typically computed independently of the other locations. We propose that an
  IDE should consider the whole codebase, not just the local context, before
  offering recommendations for a particular location. We demonstrate the
  potential benefits of our technique by presenting four concrete scenarios in
  which the Eclipse IDE fails to provide proper Quick Fixes at relevant
  locations, even though it offers those fixes at other locations. We describe
  a technique that can augment an existing IDE's recommendations to account
  for non-local information. For example, when some compilation errors depend
  on others, our technique helps the developer decide which errors to resolve
  first.},

However, because these environments represent code as plain text, it is difficult and sometimes impossible to embed interactive tools, annotations, and alternative views in the code itself. Barista is an implementation framework that enables the creation of such user interfaces by simplifying the implementation of editors that represent code internally as an abstract syntax tree and maintain a corresponding, fully structured visual representation on-screen. Barista also provides designers of editors with a standard text-editing interaction technique that closely mimics that of conventional text editors, overcoming a central usability issue of previous structured code editors.},

  abstract = {Programmers frequently use instructive code examples found on the Web to overcome cognitive barriers while programming. These examples couple the concrete functionality of code with rich contextual information about how the code works. However, using these examples necessitates understanding, configuring, and integrating the code, all of which typically take place after the example enters the user's code and has been removed from its original instructive context. In short, a user's interaction with an example continues well after the code is pasted. This paper investigates whether treating examples as "first-class" objects in the code editor - rather than simply as strings of text - will allow programmers to use examples more effectively. We explore this through the creation and evaluation of Codelets. A Codelet is presented inline with the user's code, and consists of a block of example code and an interactive helper widget that assists the user in understanding and integrating the example. The Codelet persists throughout the example's lifecycle, remaining accessible even after configuration and integration is done. A comparative laboratory study with 20 participants found that programmers were able to complete tasks involving examples an average of 43\% faster when using Codelets than when using a standard Web browser.},

The editor is oriented to the calculational mathematics involved in algorithmic problem solving and it provides features that allow reliable structure manipulation of mathematical formulae, as well as flexible and interactive presentations. We describe some of its most important features, including the use of gestures to manipulate algebraic formulae, the structured selection of expressions, definition and redefinition of operators in runtime, gesture's editor, and handwritten templates. The editor is made available in the form of a C\# class library which can be easily used to extend existing tools. For example, we have extended Classroom Presenter, a tool for ink-based teaching presentations and classroom interaction. We have tested and evaluated the editor with target users. The results obtained seem to indicate that the software is usable, suitable for its purpose and a valuable contribution to teaching and learning algorithmic problem solving.},

Higher-level domain-specific abstractions can be seamlessly integrated into C by means of modular language extension regarding syntax, type system, semantics and {IDE}. In the paper we show how language extension can address the challenges of embedded software development and report on our experience in building these extensions.

In fact, in many cases incredibly powerful and easy-to-use smart phones are going to be the first and, in less developed countries, possibly the only computing devices which virtually all people will own, and carry with them at all times. Furthermore, mobile devices do not only have touchscreens, but they are also equipped with a multitude of sensors, such as location information and acceleration, and they are always connected to the cloud. {TouchDevelop} is a novel application creation environment for anyone to script their smartphones anywhere -- you do not need a separate {PC}. {TouchDevelop} allows you to develop mobile device applications that can access your data, your media, your sensors and allows using cloud services including storage, computing, and social networks. {TouchDevelop} targets students, and hobbyists, not necessarily the professional developer. Typical {TouchDevelop} applications are written for fun, or for personalizing the phone. {TouchDevelop}'s typed, structured programming language is built around the idea of only using a touchscreen as the input device to author code. It has built-in primitives which make it easy to access the rich sensor data available on a mobile device. In our vision, the state of the program is automatically distributed between mobile clients and the cloud, with automatic synchronization of data and execution between clients and cloud, liberating the programmer from worrying (or even having to know about) the details. We report on our experience with our first prototype implementation for the Windows Phone 7 platform, which already realizes a large portion of our vision. It is available on the Windows Phone Marketplace.},
